Kamsi  - Write a student records file
Ayo    - Create a way (preferrably 'class' or 'struct') for users to search for a student's            record
Ayanfe - Create a function or class that can displays all of the student records in a text          file
Kola   - Create a function or class that saves a particular student record to a file named          after the student's matric. number
Kaima  - Create a function or class that can find a student's record and change the scores          for their subjects


Note:
- The student records file should be saved in the following order:
  
	studentName,MatricNo,COS201,GST212,SEN201,MTH201,ENT211

  where you put actual numbers for the different course names

- Use error handling when implememting your classes or functions to account for any unforseen   circumstance such as invalid inputs, value errors, etc.

- You can create temporary text files for testing the functionality of your classes or   functions.

Please note that I do not need you to give me an entire program but just the function or class (or whatever you choose to do) that I want.
Feel free to reach out to me for questions and enquiries.
